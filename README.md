Calculator Web App
Project Description
This project is a fully functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The design is simple, interactive, and user-friendly, with smooth button clicks and a responsive layout.

Features:
✅ User-Friendly Interface: A clean and structured layout with a display screen and number/operator buttons.
✅ Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).
✅ Clear and Delete Functionality: Includes buttons to clear the entire input or delete the last entered digit.
✅ Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on different screen sizes using CSS Flexbox/Grid.
✅ Keyboard Support (Optional): Users can enter numbers and operations using their keyboard for better accessibility.
✅ Error Handling: Prevents invalid operations such as division by zero.

Technologies Used:
HTML5 – To create the structure of the calculator (buttons, display screen, etc.).

CSS3 – To style the calculator, including button layout, colors, and responsiveness.

JavaScript – To implement the logic for handling user input, performing calculations, and updating the display dynamically.

Project Outcome:
This project helped in improving JavaScript skills, particularly in DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic mathematical logic implementation. It also provided experience in creating interactive UI components using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
